    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>Hi! My name is <i>Yreish Pozo,</i> I was born in <b>Queens, New York</b> and <b>raised in Fajardo, Puerto Rico</b>. Had aspirations to become a plastic surgeon andd got into college and later dropped out after many incoveniences and going through the Hurricane Maria that attacked the island at the time. After dropping out and surving the aftermath of Maria and about 8 months without any electricity I decided to join the military. I enlisted through the Navy and originaly wanted to join as an IT but my ASVAB scores werent good enough at the time and I was in rush to leave home due to ignorance so I settled for less and joined as an <b>enlisted undesignated airman</b> after going through my military career and facing many life challenges, surreal experiences and very frustrating daily revealings I realized it was best for me to complete my contract and prioritize myself and follow my passion which is and always has been computers. After a lenghty process of groing through pros/cons, fears, opinons, worries, etc... I realized there was no going back, yet I had no other choice than to trust myself so I decided to deny my re-elistment offers and complete my contract. After being discharged life was hard, very different, unstable, uncertain, lonely, etc... But in the midst of everything started to become very strong and self sufficient, strated investing in my education and got various <i>CompTIA certifications</i> as well as some others that i believed could help find a job and help me move on from my militarized past. It was harder than I thought but it has gotten way better, thanks to resources been shared, I found out about my qualifying elgibility for <i>Chapter 31</i>, which is when after meeting with mny counselor and explaining my goals, she suggested some very good local resources. Soon after I found this amazing education opportunity at <b>SDGKU</b> ! Here we are! Excited to keep going on this journey and hopefully keep growing together!</p>
